This web-app is for a ficticious Malaysian restaurant named Mamak. There is a menu, an order form, and an inventory management component where authorised users can immediately update product information. 

The application was built using React. I utilised create-react-app for Webpack Tooling. Real-time application persistence and authentication was done through Firebase, and browser persistence with HTML5 LocalStorage. I deployed the app on Netlify.
